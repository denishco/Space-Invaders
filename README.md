# Space-Invaders

This project was created while following "the coding train" by Daniel Shifmann and was then edited into what it is now.
This game is called space inavders and the idea is that you are a ship flying through space and must destroy debris that is in your way.

This project is coded in javascript
It is object oriented and takes advantage of the draw function to create animations
